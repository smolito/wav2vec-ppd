M Aurelius was educated by the orator Fronto but turned aside from rhetoric to the study of the Stoic philosophy of which he was the last distinguished representative The Meditations which he wrote in Greek are among the most noteworthy expressions of this system and exhibit it favorably on its practical side His own precepts he carried out with singular consistency and both in his public and his private life he was in the highest degree conscientious He and his predecessor are noted as the only Roman emperors who can be said to have ruled with a single eye to the welfare of their subjects
